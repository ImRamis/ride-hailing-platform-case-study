# Ride-Hailing Platform Architecture: Case Study

> **DISCLAIMER**: This repository contains sanitized architecture documentation. Proprietary business logic, real client data, and internal service implementations have been removed. This repository is not open for contributions yet.

## System Overview
Distributed microservices architecture handling 12,000 RPS at peak. Serves 1.2M users across 3 countries.

### Core Services
| Service | Tech Stack | QPS | P99 Latency |
|---------|------------|-----|-------------|
| Dispatch | Go, Redis, Kafka | 4,200 | 87ms |
| Payment | Java, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ | 3,100 | 142ms |
| Tracking | Node.js, MongoDB, WebSockets | 8,500 | 63ms |
| Matching | Python, Neo4j, gRPC | 2,800 | 210ms |

## Architectural Patterns
- **Geospatial Sharding**: Location-based partitioning of databases
- **Event Sourcing**: For critical financial operations
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Graceful degradation during surge pricing
- **Predictive Scaling**: ML-based auto-scaling of stateless services

## Incident Response Case Study
**Issue**: Database write amplification during peak hours  
**Resolution**:
1. Implemented write coalescing buffer
2. Migrated to LSM-tree storage engine
3. Introduced rate-based flow control

**Results**:
- 40% reduction in database load
- P99 write latency improved from 320ms to 85ms
- Cost savings: $28k/month

## Sample Deployment
```bash
helm install ride-hailing-platform ./charts \
  --set global.replicaCount=12 \
  --set dispatch.autoscaling.enabled=true
```
